Recent Fix Applied: Fixed malformed MS Fabrication dropdown HTML structure across website

Issue Resolved: The MS Fabrication dropdown menu had malformed HTML structure:
"Door <li><a href="ms-fabrication-bhiwadi.html">MS Fabrication</a></li> Window"

Solution Applied: Corrected to proper HTML structure:
"Door &amp; Window"

Files Fixed: Applied fix to index.html and verified consistency across other HTML files

MS Fabrication dropdown now displays properly with 4 product categories:
- Door & Window (door-window)
- Fencing (fencing) 
- Tin Shade (tin-shade)
- Trolley (trolley)

Context: This fix resolves the malformed HTML structure that was causing display issues in the MS Fabrication dropdown menu navigation. All dropdown functionality including JavaScript scrolling and URL parameter navigation remains intact.
